# Callisto

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/wrike/callisto.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrike/callisto)

Callisto is an open-source Kubernetes-native implementation of [Selenium Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)).

Here you can get more information about Callisto:

* [Callisto: An Easy Way To Run Selenium Tests in the Cloud](https://medium.com/wriketechclub/callisto-an-easy-way-to-run-selenium-tests-in-the-cloud-6c1bc39c49ae) [ENG]
* [Callisto. Why did we come up with a replacement for Selenium Grid](https://habr.com/ru/companies/wrike/articles/539682/) [RUS]

## Current status

Callisto is a production-ready tool, which lets us run hundreds of thousands selenium tests per day inside Wrike.
It completely satisfies our needs, so currently we're not actively developing it.

## Architecture

#### Callisto architecture

![Callisto architecture](docs/img/callisto_architecture.png)

#### Components

* Nginx proxies requests for creating/deleting sessions to Callisto. All other requests are proxied to browser pods directly.
* Callisto creates/deletes browser pods, watches the status of pods, and creates sessions via the webdriver.
* Browser pods contain a webdriver and a browser.

Nginx and Callisto must be running inside a Kubernetes cluster in order to access browser pods directly.

## Features

* No Selenium Grid components used
* [Selenoid images](https://github.com/aerokube/images) can be used
* [Selenoid UI](https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-ui) can be used

### Chrome DevTools protocol

Starting from version 1.3.0, Callisto supports Chrome DevTools protocol.

For example, you can use it to run [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/selenium-grid) tests:

```bash
SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://callisto.example.com npx playwright test
```

## Installation

See [helm chart](https://github.com/wrike/callisto-chart) to get started.

## Configuration

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| WEB_API_HOST | str | No | 127.0.0.1 | a host to run web api |
| WEB_API_PORT | int | No | 8080 | a port to run web api |
| LOG_LEVEL | str | No | INFO | log level |
| GRAYLOG_HOST | str | No | | Graylog host address. Logging to Graylog is disabled if left empty |
| GRAYLOG_PORT | int | No | 12201 | Graylog port |
| K8S_NAMESPACE | str | No | default | k8s namespace to spawn pods |
| POD_WEBDRIVER_PATH | str | No | | webdriver path location. On selenoid images `/wd/hub` for firefox, empty for others |
| POD_WEBDRIVER_PORT | int | No | 4444 | webdriver port |
| POD_MANIFEST | str | No | /etc/callisto/pod_manifest.yaml | Path to pod manifest file |
| SENTRY_DSN | str | No | | Sentry DSN. Sentry disabled if left empty |

Resources requests/limits, browser image, screen resolution and other parameters can be configured via pod_manifest.yaml.

## Troubleshooting

Each request is marked with a unique trace id (tid). This information is available in the logs. Also, for debugging, it is recommended to set the `LOG_LEVEL` to `DEBUG`.
